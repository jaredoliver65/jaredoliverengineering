    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">In the Spring of 2020, a child named Adlei had underdeveloped legs and needed assistance moving around. Adlei's small stature posed a challenge since her insurance company would not cover the costs for a custom walker. Her insurance did offer to cover the costs for a wheelchair. However, the parents of Adlei alongside her doctor firmly believed that if given the proper support and physical training, Adlei could develop the strength to walk on her own. Adlei's doctors stated that if given the proper equipment such as a walker, she could strengthen her leg muscles and wouldn't need to be confined to a wheelchair. Originally, Adlei's parents paid the out-of-pocket expenses for a walker. However, this walker was not appropriately suited for Adlei's specific needs. Adlei had issues with the height of the walker and standing for long periods of time. As a result, she would become very tired after standing for short periods of time. This lead to shortened periods of training and decreased the chances of Adlei's situation improving.</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">My group was tasked with designing and building a mobility solution for the family that would enable Adlei to be able to walk and run so that she could build the essential muscles and structure needed for walking on her own. We determined that it would be best to have an appropriately sized walker that could both be adjustable and provide full vertical support. We designed her walker to include specific modifications including low friction casters, all aluminum frame and adjustable straps that could be attached to a variety of harnesses for vertical support.</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">One of the biggest challenges we faced during this project, was the closure of Tennessee Tech University during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our group began this project during Spring of 2020, which was right before many businesses and schools began to close due to the threat of Covid-19. When the university closed, we did not have any access to the tools needed to build the walker. We felt strongly about finishing this project, so with the approval of our advisor, we volunteered to finish this project using our own funds and materials. We did not have access to many of the machines that Tennessee Tech University offered. This meant that we would have to hand cut and measure many of the walker parts. While the cuts were not perfect, the parts were now usable for the frame. The two images shown below are the cut and fitted walker frame pieces.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">The parts now just needed to be welded. Our group did not own a personal welding machine. However, after some talking around, we were able to get in contact with a fellow Tennessee Tech employee who heard about our project and was willing to weld the walker for us. After the frame was welded, we were able to finish assembling the walker. Shown below is an image of the newly welded walker.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">After the frame was welded, we drilled holes for different bolts and hand cut threads in the legs so that casters could be installed. Finally, we decided to paint the walker to make it more exciting for Adlei. Shown below is an image of the walker after it was painted.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">Despite all of the difficulties that my group endured during this project, we were able to build and finish the walker. The two images shown below display the fully completed walker that now only needs to be delivered.</h1><br>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">With the newly finished walker, my group now set out to deliver the walker to Adlei and her parents. After delivering the walker, we were privileged to see Adlei get to try the walker for the first time and it worked great. After the walker proved to be a success, my group left and celebrated. Shown below is an image of Adlei with her new walker my group and me.</h1><br>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">A few years after the delivery, we were given updates from Adlei's parents regarding her progress towards her walking on her own. The parents stated that even within the first few uses of the walker, Adlei was able to make astounding progress. Now over a year later since receiving the walker, Adlei has developed the muscles and structure to be able to fully walk on her own. The parents were pleased to let us know that Adlei now has the opportunity to live a normal life just like every child deserves. Shown below is a picture that the parents sent us that shows Adlei walking in a store with her new first pair of shoes.</h1>

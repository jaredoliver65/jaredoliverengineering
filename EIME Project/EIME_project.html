    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">In the Spring of 2020, a child named Adlei had underdeveloped legs and needed assistance moving around. Adlei's small stature posed a challenge as her insurance company would not cover the costs for a custom walker. Insurance offered to cover the costs for a wheelchair, however, the parents of Adlei along with her doctor firmly believed in her potential to walk on her own. Adlei's doctors believed that if given the proper equipment, she could strengthen her leg muscles and wouldn't need to be confined to a wheelchair. Originally, Adlei's parents paid the out-of-pocket expenses for a walker, however, this walker was not appropriately suited for Adlei's specific needs. Adlei had issues with the height of the walker and standing for long periods of time; as a result, she would become very tired after standing for short periods of time.</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">My group was tasked with designing and building a mobility solution for the family that would enable Adlei to be able to walk and run so that she could build the essential muscles and structure needed for walking on her own. We determined that it would be best to have an appropriately sized walker that could both be adjustable and provide full vertical support. We designed her walker to include specific modifications including low friction casters, all aluminum frame and adjustable straps that could be attached to a variety of harnesses for vertical support.</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">One of the biggest challenges we faced during this project, was the closure of Tennessee Tech University during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our group began this project during Spring of 2020, which was right before many businesses and schools began to close due to the threat of Covid-19. When the university closed, we did not have any access to the tools needed to build the walker. We felt strongly about finishing this project, so with the approval of our advisor, we volunteered to finish this project using our own funds and materials. We did not have access to many of the machines that Tennesse Tech University offered, meaning we had to hand cut and measure many of the parts of the walker. While the cuts were not perfect, they provided a set of parts that just needed to be welded. Our group did not own a personal welding machine, so after some searching, we were able to get in contact with a fellow Tennessee Tech employee who heard about our project and was willing to weld the walker for us. After the frame was welded, were able to finish assembling the walker, we drilled holes for different bolts and drilled and tapped the legs for casters. Finally, we decided to paint the walker to make it more exciting for Adlei.</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: black; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">Despite the difficulties my group faced during this project, we were able to finish and deliver the walker to Adlei and her parents. We were able to see Adlei use the walker and were given updates from her parents on her progress. The adjustable straps on the walker allowed the weight to be adjusted, meaning that Adlei could work her way up to using her full weight when walking. Within the first few uses of the walker, Adlei's parents said she made astounding progress. Now over a year later since receiving the walker, Adlei has developed the muscles and structure to be able to fully walk on her own. With the ability to walk and run around as she should be able to for a child of her age, Adlei now has the opportunity to live a normal life just like every child deserves.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">The Tennessee Tech University Mechanical Engineering Department requires undergraduate mechanical engineering students to complete a senior capstone project in order to graduate. The capstone project that I was privileged to be a part of was the Air Force Research Laboratory University Design Challenge 2020-2021. The challenge was to create a mobile robot that could scale vertical walls without flying and deploy sensors that would be out of reach for people that might try to tamper with the sensors. At the beginning of the term, the team members were selected by the course instructor.</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">The newly assembled team was twenty members strong which was rather large compared to the traditional senior capstone team (typically four members). To manage the large group, we decided to create team positions and hold elections for the newly defined positions. After the elections were held, I was elected co-captain of the team overall and team lead for my sub team. Initially, we broke out into groups of five and tried to accomplish the given challenge using independent different approaches. My team decided to try to utilize propellers to force a rover robot against a wall which would create a sizable normal force and friction so that the robot could drive up the wall using small electric motor powered wheels.</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">My small group utilized SolidWorks to design an aluminum frame that could be fabricated and assembled using the onsite machine shop. The three images shown below are the SolidWorks drawings that were utilized to create the first Variable Normal Force Vehicle prototype.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">After the design of the prototype was completed, my group started the fabrication process. The fabrication task was to plasma cut the aluminum frame. This was accomplished utilizing a dxf file created from SolidWorks which was then utilized in a CNC plasma cutter machine. The image shown below shows the newly plasma cut aluminum frame.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">With the frame being cut, the aluminum frame now needed holes for the belt tensioners and motor mounts. The two images shown below show the frame with the newly drilled holes and parts laid out.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">After drilling and cutting various features, the frame was bent into shape and TIG welded to have wheel axle holders. Shown below is the completed frame with the axles and wheels attached.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">After testing, the design proved to be problematic. The propeller bolts were too long which induced vibrations when the motors started, and the motors were not able to spin the propellers fast enough to give the design enough normal force to climb up the wall.</h1> 
    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">To combat the described issues, a new prototype was designed in SolidWorks. This new design would only require enough normal force to stay pressed against the wall, but not enough to create substantial friction against the wheels. This design was essentially flying without flying. It is important to note that by this point some of the sub groups had now joined forces with my subgroup and started assisting with the prototyping. Shown below was the Solid Works drawing and the assembled design.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">After assembling the prototype, the design was tested. The prototype did not have enough lift to fully scale a 90-degree wall, but was able to climb a 70-degree inclined ramp. The main issue with this design was that the frame was kept against the wall by a propeller in the very front. When coupled with the higher elevation propellers in the back that were supposed to lift the frame, the robot began peeling off the wall. Shown below is an image of the testing.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">To combat the moment that was peeling the robot off the wall, a third design was created that had lift propellers on the same plane as the wheel axles and the propeller that keeps the robot on the wall was moved to a more central location. The image shown below is the SolidWorks model for the third design.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">Since the deadline was starting to near, the frames were now starting to be modeled before being created. The four images shown below display some of the structural analyses that were performed for different prototype designs.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">After deciding upon a frame design, a prototype was fabricated and assembled. The image shown below was the completed prototype. without wiring.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">This prototype proved to be too heavy to climb a 90-degree vertical wall and needed to be modified. The frame was modified to remove substantial portions of various sections and was skeletonized. In addition to making the frame lighter, an additional propeller was added to the front which would increase the lift by approximately 50%. The image shown below is the assembled prototype and the image after is an image taken about 10 minutes later after an unfortunate crash during testing.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">After the last failure, we decided to go back to forcing the rover against the wall. To do this, we utilized three propellers, an ultralight frame, spike wheels, and servo motors to power the wheels. The design worked flawlessly. Shown below is an image of the final assembled design.</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20; color: blue; font-family: monospace; text-align: left">After completing the design, the only task that remained was the testing. The two images shown below display the successful testing of the final Variable Normal Force Vehicle design.</h1>
